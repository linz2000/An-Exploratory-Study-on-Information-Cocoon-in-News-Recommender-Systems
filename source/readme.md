# An Exploratory Study on Information Cocoon in News Recommender Systems

## 1. running details

- config.py -- basic configuration: dataset, model, cuda, etc.

- rec_simulation.py --  interaction simulation between user and news recommender system.

- rec_filter.py -- information cocoon crack filter.

Note: before running the above files, the model needs to be trained in advance.
